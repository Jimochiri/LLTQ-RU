Elodie's coronation day was marred by the arrival of a contingent of peasants from Caloris, angry over the continuing disruption that had followed the earthquake. Soldiers were able to keep them out of range of the new Queen, but the protest was considered to be a poor omen for her reign.

Elodie's coronation day was scarred by tragedy. Rumor spread among the commoners that there was not enough food at the festivities for everyone, and a stampede broke out as each fought to be among the lucky few who would be fed. There were not enough soldiers on hand to maintain order, and a number of people were trampled to death in the chaos.

Joslyn never properly recovered from his encounter with the King of Shanjia. He did awaken a week after the coronation, but his mind and his memory were badly damaged. He was no longer fit to govern his duchy without aid, much less explain the mysterious events of the duel. Still, he recognised his daughter and was pleased to see her wearing the crown.

Elodie feared that predatory women might take advantage of her father's weakness, but Joslyn showed no interest in remarrying. His mind lingered in the past, not the future. He did, however, acknowledge and adopt a previously-unknown natural son as the next heir to the duchy of Caloris.

The common folk of Merva, however, were not so agreeable. A minor rebellion was soon underway, in which administrative paperwork and tax revenue were constantly "misplaced", and "accidents" befell any official who tried to investigate.

Merva was a small province with few resources and a small population; it hardly seemed worth the effort of sending the royal army in to keep order. A balance slowly developed in which the rest of Nova pretended Merva didn't exist, and vice-versa... and the Mervans liked it that way.

The tragic events of the past year left a gap in the Novan power structure, since Joslyn, Duke of Caloris, died with no acknowledged heir to his title. Elodie, of course, was the reigning Queen, which by tradition would prevent her from holding the duchy as well.

In order to resolve the situation quickly and keep the lands within her family, Elodie offered to grant control of Caloris to her uncle Laurent, the current Duke of Merva. The title of Merva, in the meantime, would be transferred to her aunt Lucille, who had always claimed to be descended from the extinct Mervan line. It would then be up to that couple which of their children inherited which territories.

Lacking a better option, Elodie chose to leave the title empty for the moment, appointing administrators to govern Caloris until either she or her paternal uncle could produce an heir of the blood.

The remaining family members pleaded that they had not known, but they were still stripped of their titles. For the time being, Merva would return to the direct control of the crown; however, if the survivors proved their loyalty, the line might one day be restored.

The young Queen sponsored expeditions of trained knights to venture into the Old Forest and attempt to exterminate the monsters within. Unfortunately, black magic would not give up its grip on Nova so easily. Many lives were lost, and with their blood, the monsters appeared to grow even stronger...

The subject of magic and Lumens remained a slightly uncomfortable one for the citizens of Nova. Perfectly fine for the Queen, who had inherited it by divine right, but not something that other people should be aspiring towards. Look at all the terrible things that happened when that power fell into the wrong hands!

As an openly acknowledged Lumen, Julianna, Duchess of Ursul, was met with public suspicion whenever she journeyed outside of her Duchy. At times, that suspicion was accompanied with thrown vegetables.

It did not matter that Elodie supported her fully as a member of the noble court. That only led the commoners to whisper that Julianna was a bad influence on their Queen.

Others known publicly to be Lumens, such as the Duchess of Ursul and the Countess of Nix, were met with public suspicion whenever they left their home territories. Not even the Queen's open support was enough to endear them to the common people.

All in all, it was generally considered a good thing that the old Duchess of Ursul had been replaced. She was a Lumen, after all, and probably up to no good. But then someone would raise the question of just where she had disappeared to...

After the halt of the Shanjian invasion, relations across the western sea remained calm and trade flourished. Shanjia's expansionist phase seemed to have come to a halt.

Sometime later, a special trade ship from Shanjia arrived with a tribute for Queen Elodie. There was a beautiful harpsichord inlaid with ivory and pearl and golden roses, as well as two paintings, clearly made by children, depicting a pink-haired angel.

After that presentation, King-Consort Thaddeus withdrew from court and spent months involving himself utterly with hunting and the countryside, ignoring his young wife. It took Elodie some time to realise the problem. Not only did he suspect she was having an affair with Togami of Shanjia, but he also had no desire to confront her or interfere at all in whatever she might be up to.

The loss of their fleet was a terrible setback for Shanjia. However, as with a garden weed, if the root is not burned out completely the infestation may return even worse than before. The King of Shanjia had somehow escaped either drowning or capture and returned to his homeland to plot revenge against Nova.

While Shanjia had lost many soldiers, they now had new allies. Leaders of other countries were shocked at Elodie's cavalier treatment of the Shanjian prisoners of war and determined to teach this upstart Queen a lesson. Nova would be under siege for years to come.

Elodie's choice to return all the Shanjian prisoners for ransom made it easier for Shanjia to restore their military to the level necessary to maintain order, but it would take many years before they could field a conquering horde.

Raising a new army put a strain on the Shanjian royal treasury, which brought internal tensions among the former city-states to the fore. It would be some years before Shanjia could manage to field a conquering horde again.

True to his word, Togami and the Shanjians ignored Nova in the years to come, focusing their efforts instead on the far northern continent of Borealis.

He was no doubt chasing the rumors of "Lumen Shamans" ruling over those barren wastes, rumors which Elodie now knew to be false. Let him waste his time in that hostile land as long as he wanted, he would not find any crystals there.

Long ago, Borealis had been home to the largest known collection of Lumens in the world. If their crystals remained and Togami found them, he could become unstoppable.

Or else, Elodie prayed, the magic itself might turn upon him and destroy him. Surely no one man was meant to control that much power. Even an entire domain was too small a space. That was, after all, what had turned Borealis into a wasteland. Perhaps some remnant of that ancient war would still be active and swallow him whole.

And yet, he did make mistakes. He had failed to remove all of the crystals of power from Nova, after all. If he came their way again, this time the Novan Lumens would be ready for him.

First came the recriminations and demands from the Queen of Shanjia, devastated by the death of her husband, which Elodie ignored. Next came the subtler approaches, the quiet gratitude and offers for alliances from ministers who were thrilled to see Togami gone.

Elodie ignored those also, which was just as well, since the next thing to arrive was the preserved head of one of those 'traitorous' ministers, sent by the Queen of Shanjia as a warning.

Relations between Nova and Tombula, the neighbor to the north, had not been cordial for many years, as the revolutionary Tombulans did not approve of hereditary rule. However, the two domains had managed to exist in a peaceful stalemate.

After Elodie came to the throne, however, that pretense of peace cracked and crumbled. The Tombulans invaded the duchy of Ursul, and Nova was forced to surrender the northernmost county in order to maintain a stronger defensive line.

Elodie's reign would not be a peaceful one. Her impetuous bluff of an alliance with Talasse against Ixion backfired; those two domains, angry at having been used and lied to, instead joined their forces to harass Nova's southern border.

Weakened by the Shanjian invasion, Nova lacked the strength to resist their combined assault. Elodie was eventually forced to cede large portions of both Maree and Elath, and hope that her future successors would be able to reclaim them.

The matter of the rulership of Elath had to be dealt with eventually. After so many recent troubles, the last thing Elodie wanted was armed conflict between Nova and Talasse. Still, while Talarist, the Duke of Sedna, was the nearest blood heir, he was a foreigner, and the rulership of Elath had been tenuous for too long already.

To solve the problem, Elodie found a compromise. A promising native administrator would be raised to the rank of Duchess of Elath, and then married to the Duke of Sedna. Their wedding would strengthen ties across the border without weakening either position.

Tensions remained high between Nova and Talasse. After his initial attempt to claim his 'birthright' was driven back, the Duke of Sedna did not attempt to invade again, but he did institute new policies that made life difficult for traders crossing the border. At the same time, there was a marked increase in raiders and sneak-thieves throughout the area.

Talarist swore he knew nothing about it - that he would never hurt a child, and any agents involved were not operating under his orders. He was an opportunist, not an assassin.

Relations between Nova and Talasse turned markedly sour after Elodie's open jilting of the Duke of Sedna. Talarist declared himself the rightful ruler of the duchy of Elath, and led an armed force onto Novan soil in his attempt to claim it, tacitly supported by the King of Talasse.

All of Nova rejoiced upon the birth of Elodie's first child - all save for those in the family of her husband, who thought the young prince rather suspiciously fair-haired. King-Consort Thaddeus showed no interest in pursuing the rumors, and was very protective of the mental well-being of his son. Anyone daring to insinuate in his presence would soon come to regret it.

It was whispered in certain quarters that Elodie spent too much time alone at gatherings with handsome young nobles who were not her husband. She was the Queen, of course, and had the right to entertain herself as she pleased, but that didn't mean everyone would approve.

It was something of a private joke between the queen and her friend Gwenelle, Duchess of Sudbury, that one day Elodie would marry Gwenelle's young half-brother. After all, he wouldn't be eligible for years, and Elodie had the whole world to choose from.

But what with one thing and another, the Queen never quite found the right husband. To her surprise, eight years after she had taken the throne, she discovered that little Anciet had taken all that joking quite seriously... had, in fact, fallen in love with her.

One of the young queen's closest confidants was Briony of Mead, whom Elodie formally appointed as her royal Lady-in-Waiting, and less formally, as the Lady of the Royal Bedchamber. The two carried out a very public flirtation, complete with moonlit serenades under balconies and the ritual slaying of imaginary dragons.

After the wedding, matters were not always so rosy. The new king had his own political agenda, and maintaining her authority was a constant struggle for Elodie.

Elodie's fascination with the tanned biceps of a peasant baker was not something she cared to admit openly. Instead, she engaged Evrard for the position of Royal Food Taster, as he had once suggested, and amused herself by watching him sample everything from creampuffs to buttered snails.

Fortunately for Evrard, the candied petals only caused terrible stomach cramps rather than anything fatal. Elodie herself tended him through his recovery, after which she assigned him to new, more personal duties. The nobility disapproved, but the common people were pleased to see their young queen in love.

However, making 'that boy' her servant only emphasized the divide between them. He was decorative and entertaining, but not someone with whom Elodie could share her burdens. She would go on to marry for duty and the stability of the realm, with only the occasional wistful glance...

Elodie attempted to locate the baker's boy who had captured her attention, but it seemed that his family had closed up shop and relocated. Alice, the maid, refused to say where they might have gone, not even after Elodie had her whipped and thrown into the dungeon. After that, even Alice disappeared. It seemed Elodie was destined for disappointment.

Deciding that one handsome face was just as good as another, Elodie turned her attentions to the Earl of Mima, who was thrilled at his good fortune. They had two sons, each as fair as his father - and neither was ever allowed to eat blueberry cookies.

Even after her coronation, Elodie liked to don a ragged cape and hood and sneak out of her castle to visit a certain bakery. Evrard's father nearly collapsed with terror when he realised the identity of his mysterious customer, but 'that boy' never responded to his Queen with anything other than a cheeky grin and a warm croissant.

It was refreshing for Elodie to have a friend who showed neither deference nor scorn for her position, and for the next few years, friendship was all that it was. However, somewhere along the way, she grew to depend on Evrard as more than just a source of stability to help her face all the pressures of her ruling life.

Once she recognised the direction that her heart was turning, Elodie had difficult decisions to make. She was Queen and could do as she liked - but Nova was her responsibility. She might someday need to marry for the good of the realm. Without the full backing of her people, she dared not indulge herself.

Elodie proposed marriage to Kevan, the Earl of Io, and was accepted. However, the wedding festivities went awry when the groom suddenly attempted to skewer his royal bride.

It took months for him to talk openly about his past. The seduction by his stepfather, the relationship it developed into, the terrible night when his little brother Thaddeus saw what he should not have seen, and then his mother's horrified rejection. Arisse divorced her husband Jael at once, ordering him to stay away from Kevan. When he didn't, she had him killed. Was it any wonder that Kevan had deep problems with family, love, and trust?

Elodie proposed marriage to Kevan, the Earl of Io, but was rejected without explanation or apology. At first, the young Queen's feelings were somewhat hurt.

Elodie proposed marriage to Ignatius, Duke of Ursul, who was not pleased to be approached by a girl younger than his own daughter. While he would not accept her suit, neither could he bring himself to openly refuse after all she had done for him. They entered into a state of romantic cease-fire, in which he would agree to spend time with her as long as she made no inappropriate advances.

Ignatius expected Elodie's interest to flicker and fade. She was, after all, young - and he had withstood years of disappointment and betrayal before, first from his father when he was passed over in favor of Julianna, and then from his wife, who had grown all too close to her unstable sibling. Even his children abandoned him, preferring the court of Mead where they had been raised.

Elodie indulged in a number of relationships throughout her reign, but her most long-lasting was with her maidservant, Alice. The former baker's daughter was greatly envied for the fine wardrobe and glittering jewels gifted her by her royal mistress. Especially the diamonds set into the silver collar that she was obliged to wear at all times.

The rest of Nova watched these proceedings with discontent, wondering what the lack of an heir would mean for their future. At least Elodie had relatives... it seemed increasingly likely that one of her cousins would eventually inherit the crown.

Elodie refused to be rushed into marriage, wanting for herself the strong romantic connection that her parents had once had. It was many years before she was, at last, swept off her feet by a young earl with sparkling green eyes and a talent for pastry. He enjoyed surprising the Queen with new confections and even prepared their wedding cake.

The invention of the printing press sparked the beginning of a new age of literacy and knowledge. No longer were books the sole preserve of the noble and wealthy; now information and ideas could be easily passed from one place to another.

The new hospital funded by Queen Elodie offered medical services to the common people, but more importantly, it allowed doctors and herbalists to come together and share information. Trading knowledge increased skill levels and made better care available to all. Even those specialists who catered directly to the elite were benefited by offering their services long enough to learn.

Elodie's interest in weapons and dueling led her to invite foreign masters from far and wide to visit Nova and share their secrets.  That expertise would also improve the performance of the Royal Guard and provide security for the crown's heirs.

Elodie often found escape from the pressures of ruling by spending time in natural surroundings with the royal horses and other animals.  This feeling of kinship led her to declare new laws to improve animal welfare in Nova.

Elodie's studies of history revealed previously glossed-over facts from Nova's past, such as why the Novan empire only blossomed after the fall of Borealis: The old Lumen warlords were forced to flee to more fertile ground after their constant squabbling damaged their homeland beyond repair.

That also explained why, from the beginning, magic in Nova was viewed with caution.  But as memory faded, caution did as well, leading to a cycle of magical destruction that waxed and waned over the centuries.

Managing a country is always a juggling act, but Elodie had mastered the art of being one step ahead of the game.  Her information network allowed her to predict the moves of her enemies and outmaneuver them, allowing Nova to gain a little more power and prestige every time.

Elodie's interest in rare plants and their uses led her to build a private garden and laboratory to develop new substances - in particular, poisons.  Developing new and exotic ways to dispose of her rivals was one of her favorite hobbies.

Rumor reached Elodie's ears that a hospital had been constructed in Ixion, and that some of the peasants of Maree were defecting southwards to have access to this wonder.

Elodie's interest in trade and economics led her to treat country management as something of a game, and a game she was very good at.  Why waste lives conquering when you can dominate by natural superiority?  Her manipulations increased Nova's ties with its neighbors and raised the standard of living for all of its citizens.

Elodie never truly got over the loss of her parents.  She sought solace in religion, wanting to believe that everything that happened was part of some greater plan, and therefore willingly accepted the guidance of the high priestess when it came to making decisions for Nova.

Those monsters eventually broke loose, killing their captors and destroying the Old Capital on Kathre Lake.  The resulting chaos shook the Empire.
Two hundred years ago, a great force of darkness covered Nova, threatening to wipe out all life in the domain.  It took the self-sacrifice of the Queen and her complement of Lumens to defeat that doom.  Only the Duke of Ursul refused to join in the defense and therefore survived.

A Lumen once tried to lift the curse from an enchanted spring whose water was poisonous and glowed green.  After dispelling the magic, she tasted the water and fell dead - the green glow was a not a curse, but a spell placed by a Lumen long before to warn everyone away from the spring's natural poison.

A Lumen may willingly surrender control of his or her magic to another.  This was how the Novan Empire came to dominate the world - a growing force of Lumens focused on a single ruler, granting that King or Queen immense power.

It is now believed that strong magical power attracts danger.  Therefore, after the doomshadow was banished, the crystals of the fallen Dukes and Duchesses were destroyed.  Only the crown - and the duchy of Ursul - maintain active Lumens.
